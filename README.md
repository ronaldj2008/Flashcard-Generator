# Flashcard-Generator

INSTRUCTIONS:

Create a new GitHub repository, named Flashcard-Generator or something similar. Clone this to your local drive.
Create a BasicCard constructor. It should accept front and back arguments.
Create a ClozeCard constructor. It should accept text and cloze arguments.
ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the cloze-deleted portion of the text.
ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the partial text.
ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the full text.
ClozeCard should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does not appear in the input text.
Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.
As your application will not have a front end, your only need to determine an efficient way to store cloze-deleted cardsâ€”you don't have to solve the problem of displaying them. You are free to decide how you'd like to implement this. One might represent the above flashcard thus:
The bulk of this assignment is implementing ClozeCard. If you build a robust ClozeCard implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.


TECHNOLOGY:

Node.js, Javascript

COMMENTS:

Used a node.js and javascript to build a flash card game using multiple js files.
